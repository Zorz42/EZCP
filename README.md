# EZCP
A rust framework to easily create tasks for competitive programming

Planned features:
- generate tests and save them into files
- generate solutions automatically
- optionally have a testcase checker
- make a checker if there are multiple valid solutions
- have subtask dependencies automatically
- have a premade graph generator to make generating graph test cases easier
- premade array generator
- more common and useful premade generators
- (maybe) automatically generate some parts of the statement (time/memory limit, subtasks, samples...)
- (maybe) test if a solution passes exactly the subtasks it was meant to pass (could be a lot of work)
